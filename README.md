# JSON CVLine Schema

## Standard, Specification, Schema

This JSON schema is for the [MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node) stack application](http://mean.io) that is currently being developed as a resource for scholars to create their own, open and online portfolio &ndash one line at a time. The application, CVLine, will offer scholars a way to easily add and update their CV/portfolio information, which will then be served as API endpoints for scholars to use in conjunction with HTML/CSS/JS templates.

This repo serves as a means to obtain feedback on the structure of the JSON. Here are some possible areas to comment on/review:

* What's missing?
* What's unclear about the naming conventions?
* What's unclear about the structure?

This schema is building off from work that I had done to create my own online portfolio that uses the JSON format, but also takes a cue from the interesting [Resume JSON project](https://jsonresume.org/). The Resume JSON project's goals include developing a standardized specification for resumes, but it is suited more toward the professional-industry domains. This schema does not share in such a goal for a broad standard and is more localized to academic work and this application, specifically. The one JSON object and properties borrowed from the Resume JSON project is the "general" information.

## Contribute

I (Chris) want to encourage you to participate in the formation of this schema, as a way to better structure the data model for the CVLine. Feel free to join the discussions [here on GitHub](https://github.com/cvline/cvline-schema/issues). Also feel free to fork it and add new suggestions that way, too.
